This is the Netrek timeline,  
originally by Andy Mc'Fadden,  
and later revised by Nick Trown.  

This is from the 18-Jan-1995 version, wikified and spellchecked by AKB4 03-Jun-2006.  Converted to MediaWiki format by [[User:Quozl|Quozl]] on 2009-03-11.

This version also included the following notes:
* All dates are in month/year or as close as I can get to it. 
* The information here should be completely accurate. Errors should be limited to errors of omission (though there are probably LOTS of those).
