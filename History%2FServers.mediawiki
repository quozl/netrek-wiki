Public Netrek Servers, through Jan 1 1994
By Andy Mc'Fadden (fadden@catapent.com)

Revised: 09-May-94

This is an attempt to list some basic information about EVERY public Netrek server that ever was. My goal is to list the people who set them up and get a rough idea of when the servers were running.

Sometimes Netrek servers go through several names. When possible, all of the names are listed, in reverse chronological order. In any event, they're sorted by the most recent name.

Sometimes the same host will have more than one server running at once, or will alternate different days of the week. This is not dealt with in a very clean way. Also, sometimes the people who set up the servers leave and somebody else takes over maintenance, but I'm not going to try to track those.

The dates for most of these are based on the earliest appearance of the server in Tom Holub's server FAQ posting (thanks go to Sam Shen and Neil Cook for sending me about half a dozen each; Sam gets gthe prize for the earliest known FAQ posting). The earliest date that the server is listed on an FAQ sheet was used as the server inception date; similarly, the first date that the server is listed as &quot;down&quot; is used as the retirement date. Since I don't think I have the complete collection, these dates may be off by a few months, but they're at least somewhat accurate.

I'm not going to try to list private or temporary servers (for INL or clue games); this is mainly for &quot;pickup&quot; game servers. A reasonable criteria for recent servers is that they have to have been advertised on the metaserver. I've included some extra notes when I think they're interesting or they'll help people remember a server.

Categories for Netrek servers are:

* Bronco - the original; includes scam, bronco, guzzler, calvin, and many others.
* Chaos - bronco with mods; wrap-around walls, Galaxy ships, ping-pong plasmas. KSU Chaos refers to a particular variety.
* Sturgeon - sturgeon-style upgrade server; loosely fits any server where upgrades are a central component.
* Hockey - Netrek hockey; may also include Netrek soccer.
* Paradise - paradise-style; any variant of Paradise fits here.
* INL - INL-style server; a public server with INL features.
* Special - special server 

&quot;now&quot; in the When column refers to Jan 1 1994.
