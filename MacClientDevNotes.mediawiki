Below are some excerpts from traffic on the netrek-dev mailing list. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Perhaps the basis for some FAQs. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
Other clues about mactrek behaviors can probably be gleaned from the &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bugtracking system on sourceforge. (insert url here...) &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
===local server packaging===

* Zach wrote in astonishment: &quot;wow how did u setup local server packaged with the client and get it working?&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
Hi Zach, well the server is simply compiled the normal way and is &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stored under /usr/local/games the tricky part was including the &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dependend package that are not natively on tiger within the &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;deployment. The client simply checks if it can find the dir and &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;launches the server as a seperate NSTask, you can even create &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;additional robots, but they run just as they would from the &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;commandline. They are simply wrapped in an NSTaskWrapper which &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;monitors the processes. I did notice that the client does not always &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;close the server, resulting in a very long time robots fighting other &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;robots. (They had reached commander by the time i got back [[image:http://wiki.us.netrek.org/wiki/modern/img/smile.png width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; caption=&quot;:-)&quot;]] &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
===coding platform and codebase===

* &quot;Is the source available? I'd feel more comfortable if I could make a debug build I can step through. Did you use Xcode? autofu? I found autofu so painful on OSX that I gave up porting COW to OSX.&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
[...] &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
It's Xcode, and not a port of COW but of Jtrek (well that was based on COW too) &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;it's re-written in Objective C and beyond the handling of the &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;communication i doubt if you recognize anything from COW [[image:http://wiki.us.netrek.org/wiki/modern/img/smile.png width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; caption=&quot;:-)&quot;]] &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
===Could Mac Trek be ported to linux?=== 
&lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
**From: Narcis &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;To: netrek-dev &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Date: Tue, 31 Oct 2006 22:41:29 +0100** &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
[...] In theory it could &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;be compiled on Linux too. The nextstep frameworks are open source, i &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;would probably need to rewrite mayor parts using only the &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;constructions available in that frame work... &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
I'll leave that as an excercise [[image:http://wiki.us.netrek.org/wiki/modern/img/smile.png width=&quot;15&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; caption=&quot;:-)&quot;]] &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

[...] &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
* &quot;Yeah this client looks cool. I wish there was way to compile it for Linux! Is there any way to get the code working in Linux?&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
Well it rests on top of Cocoa (Mac OS X), which means that many &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;functions are specific to that framework, &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;but Cocoa is based on nextstep which is now openstep. The gnu &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;compiler supports it, it is just that apple &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;added many many things to Cocoa which may or may not be in openstep. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Most notably the Aqua server &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;which is ... well neutrally put.. different from X11. I think it &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;will be a very large port action and the code &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;was my first large Objective-C project, so not really that clean. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
The ideas to learn would be &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- seperation of drawing and communication. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- menu structure seperate from game screen &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- flexibility only for expert users, (currently only in source code) &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- must run out of the box &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;- scroll function (though this leads to a projection of the gamegrid &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to the display that is variable.) &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
I believe that it is quicker to create a KDE or Qt application, embed &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;the communication from COW in a &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;thread and use signals and threads to implement the above on gui level. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

* Zach pondered &quot;27 MB for a netrek client. Wow that must be a new record ;-)&quot; &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
Yes, mainly because the game does not uses a fixed resolution. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Everything is stored in the game &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;grid and then projected with a variable scale factor to the screen. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This mean that a ship is still 40x40 ? &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in the game grid but may be smaller or larger then 40x40. The source &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;bitmaps are therefore quite large &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
Also the theming allows for multiple sets of sounds (2 included), all &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;required frameworks are static and &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;macos binaries are actually a PPC and intel bineary glueed together. &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
The bitmaps should also be reusable for NetrekXP since the have the &lt;span class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;same format......
